# Changelog

All user-visible changes to dex. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); before v1.0.0 minor
versions may break flags and the config file.

## Unreleased

- Added: dex, with the siblings at agentkit v0.0.7, agentturn and
  agentturn/session v0.0.16, agentsession v0.0.21, agenttool v0.0.15,
  openresponses and its anthropic and gemini providers v0.0.14,
  agentpolicy v0.0.11, agentskill v0.0.11, agentmemory v0.0.10 and
  agentsmd v0.0.2.
- Added: `glob`, `grep` and `ls` tools.
- Added: the file tools are confined to the working directory, through
  an `os.Root`: a path outside it, a `..` out, or a symbolic link out is
  refused.
- Added: providers, `-provider ollama|openai|anthropic|gemini`, `-model`
  and `-base-url`, with keys from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  and `GEMINI_API_KEY`. Ollama stays the default.
- Added: a config file, `~/.config/dex/config.json`, and a per-project
  `.dex/config.json`; `-config` names another user file.
- Added: a default policy that is always on: the read-only tools and a
  few safe commands run, writes and every other command ask. `bash` is
  decided per subcommand. `-no-policy` turns it off.
- Security: a bash call is auto-allowed only if it is one simple command in a
  safe subset of the syntax with read-only arguments (git status, diff,
  log, show; ls; pwd; go version; go env NAME); everything else asks. Fixes
  comment, `$'..'` and `>&word` handling in the splitter that serves asked
  commands. Git runs with the repository's fsmonitor, pager, ssh command and
  hooks neutralised and `--no-ext-diff --no-textconv`.
- Security: `go test`, `go build`, `go vet` and `go list` are no longer
  auto-allowed; the README says how to allow them in the user config.
- Security: the project config is tighten-only; it may no longer set the
  provider, model, base_url, think, instructions_file, skills_dirs,
  memory_dir, mcp_servers or pass_env, nor add allow rules or carve-outs.
- Security: path rules match the normalised path; glob, grep and ls are
  matched on where they search.
- Security: AGENTS.md files and `.dex/skills` that link out of the workspace
  are not read; reported as omitted.
- Security: bash commands and MCP servers start without credentials in their
  environment (`pass_env` names exceptions); `max_read_bytes` bounds `read`
  and `edit`; grep and glob skip non-regular files and cannot be made
  exponential; the session store and memory are `0700`; `/mcp add` uses the
  `mcp__<name>__` prefix and names may not contain `__`; terminal control
  sequences are stripped from output.
- Security: git commands run unasked only if the repository's own git config
  names no program (filters, textconv, askpass, editor, proxies,
  credential helpers, drivers ...), the question names the key; the gpg
  programs are `/bin/false` and `%G` in a format asks. The git
  neutralisation environment and `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` apply only to
  auto-allowed commands, not to ones you approve. `..` in an `ls` or git
  path asks and links are resolved segment by segment; a `:` in a git
  revision or pathspec asks; bare `go env` asks. The credential scrub covers
  `_KEY`, `_PAT`, `_PWD`, `_JWT`, `_CREDENTIALS`, `_AUTH`, PASSWORD, SECRET,
  DATABASE_URL, SSH_AUTH_SOCK and URLs with passwords; credential-file paths
  pass through. MCP stderr is cleaned. `-trust-skills` trusts only skills in
  directories you named.
- Added: more read-only commands run unasked: git combined short flags and
  space-separated values, `branch`, `rev-parse`, `ls-files`, `remote -v`,
  `blame`, `stash list`, `tag`, `describe`, `shortlog`, `config` reads;
  trailing `2>&1`, `2>/dev/null`, `>/dev/null`; pipes into `head`, `tail`,
  `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `cut`, `grep`; `&&` sequences and `cd` into the
  workspace; `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `grep` on named files; `ls` with
  globs. Bash output is capped at 50 KiB in memory.
- Changed: `-confirm` is gone, since the policy is always on; `-key` and
  `DEX_API_KEY` are gone, since a key is read from the provider's own
  variable; `-base` is now `-base-url`; the default `-model` follows the
  provider.
- Changed: the front is chosen in `cmd/dex/front.go`, the place a
  terminal UI plugs in; `-front` names it, and only `repl` exists.
