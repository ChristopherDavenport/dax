# plain vX.Y.Z tag is published yet, any vX.Y.Z of the module's major
# version is the first release. Prerelease versions are refused.
#
# Run it before the tag is written; make release does. Nothing is public
# until the push, so a refusal costs a git reset --hard HEAD~1 and a git
# tag -d at worst.
#
# This repository is a single module, so every tag is a root tag. The
# sibling repositories with nested modules carry a longer version of this
# script that also holds a <dir>/vX.Y.Z tag to its module's go.mod and to
# the root tag of the same version. If a nested module is ever added
# here, that is the part to bring over.
